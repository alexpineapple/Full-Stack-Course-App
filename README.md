# Full-Stack-Course-App
This is a full-stack web app for a database of courses, with a slight Star Wars Twist! At first anyone can retrieve information on existing courses, however, users will need to create an account to interact with the database to create new courses. Only the course owner is allowed to update or delete their existing course. 

## App Prerequisites
Users must first install dependencies with `npm install`, followed by `npm start` to run the server.
This action needs to be repeated in both the `api` and `client` folders.
